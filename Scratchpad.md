Gaps in the question and my assumptions.
Gap 1: How many block objects can be positioned on the grid at every single instance in time T. 
Assumption 1: I assumed the explorer to blocker capacity follows a 1:1 ratio/relationship. That is 1 explorer and 1 block object.

This is how i have imagined it on paper


CommandQueue.java
CommandQueueInitializer.java
A command queue which is a random collection of possible next events


REPORT is framed as an observable event which will keep track of the current positions

RoutesHistory.java: 
A collection that stores how an explorer went about it's previous journey.


exploreShortestPath(){

}
